        - To get an random API Key visit [esphome docu](https://esphome.io/components/api.html#configuration-variables) 


## Preparing the Hardware
1. Adding new device to ESPhome in Home Assistant:
    - Go to ESPhome in Home Assistant
    - Click on "+ NEW DEVICE" on the bottom right
    - Enter the name you want.
    - Skip the next step
    - Select ESP32
    - Skip the next step
    - Click on "EDIT" at the new created device

2. Enter and Preparing the code
    - Remove the shown code
    - Enter the code from the espcode.c file (open with and text editor)
        - make sure you keep the format and tabstops in the file.
    - Change the device name in line 2, to what ever the device should be called.
    - Check the Wifi section.
    - Save the Code.

3. First installation
    - Connect the ESP32 with your PC.
    - Click the "INSTALL" button on the top right.
    - Select Plug into this computer.
    - In the popup window select the COM-port where your ESP is connected (replug the ESP32 to check which is the port you need.)
        - If it is not shown, try to install the driver (most likely CP2102 if it is the ESP32 linked above)
    - Installation should start after clicking connect.
    - Wait to finish the installation.

4. Connect the matrix to the ESP32
    - Connect Matrix 5V to ESP32 5V
    - Connect Matrix GND to ESP32 GND
    - Connect Matrix DIN to ESP32 G32 (can be changed in the code)

## Preparing the Automation (entities has to be changed to match your environment)
1. To show the Time just copy the text of the example_time_automation.yaml file to a new Automation in Home Assistant.
    - This will update the time every minute.
    - This requires an time entity    
2. To get some more advanced information. Create a second Automation and copy the example_inforamtion_automation.yaml into it.
    - For this you need a input boolean helper entity called "input_boolean.helper_display_info_matrixclock"
    - For this to work you need to change the Automation from the first step to the code of example_advanced_time.yaml
    - This will show information like weather and grocery delivery from PicNic.
        - For the weather information there is a translation. This should be changed to your preferred language ðŸ˜‰
    - This will reoccurs every 5 minutes
